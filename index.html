	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>My journey began from Singapore where I was born, at age seven, I migrated to Australia with my family. This was where I completed my high school and without thought, chose to continue higher studies into the realm of nursing. Like other high school graduates, there were some like me who had little idea in what they would do in their life. My father was a nurse and was able to bring my family to Australia and support me and my sister through private schooling, therefore I decided Nursing was a safe bet. <br>
	<br>
	Upon completion of my undergraduate degree, I found work for one year in aged care, then the remaining time of my nursing career in the cardiology ward of the hospital. It was there I honed my critical thinking, work ethic and time management skills. Nursing was a rewarding career, it gave me satisfaction helping out those in need, both patients and my colleagues but I began losing interest in the field, I began enjoying more of my time in solitude, felt burnt out from prolonged interaction with others and realised that I performed better in an environment more conducive to my introverted personality.<br>
	<br>
	There were other areas of nursing I could have entered however I lacked the ambition or interest to further myself in nursing, that was when I knew this would be the highest point I would have reached in my nursing career. This was when I decided to pursue other career pathways. As I searched the internet for other career options, one advertisement came from my news feed - a bootcamp offering various courses with a job guarantee and one area that captured my interest - software engineering. I knew little about the field of IT, but always had an interest in technology. In between work and chores, I would always spend time either on my phone or computer, though mostly gaming but appreciated how technology has progressed, evolved and shaped society to the world we live in now. Learning software engineering to me was an opportunity to learn another language, a language with universal applications that will always be relevent during this era where technology prevails. After speaking with one of staff from AcademyXI, this was the moment where I decided to commit the next five months of my life reinventing my career.

	<b><i>Moving too fast, life is moving in slow-mo
			I'm a God, better ask if you don't know</b></i>
	Homie, better put your pride aside
	I'm a Benz and you're more like a Volvo
	<sup>Your best stuff looks like my worst
	Synapses fire and burst
	Got the whole crew with me
	'Bout to deal damage, you know we ain't average</sup>
	I ain't gonna say this again but this is my time
	<sub>Better look in my eyes, I'm a genius in disguise
	Wear my heart on my sleeve
	And you forced to oblige to a king in his prime</sub>
	Everybody get in line
	Sit backthe stars align
	I finesse live my life  a diamond in the rough and now I shine
	<br>
Ay, no one can stop us, they'll try but they won't
Ay, nada nos puede parar, oh, no
We're wide awake now, our eyes arre running this world, we keeping it turning
We're living like giants, yeah, giants
We're bigger than giants, we giants

		<h3>AcademyXI</h3>
		<p>After deciding to commit myself to a career of IT, I knew there were other pathways available for me to enter the field but having a wife and stepchildren who were still both dependent on me, rent and other living expenses to maintain, I did not have the luxury of completing a three year degree in university. AcademyXI course was much shorter to complete, provided online courses with regular one on one support through online sessions, which suited my learning environment more than physcially attended campus and completing my education in a more traditional, diadetic form of learning. Adding icing to the cake, a job guaratee was inclusive upon completion of the software engineering course, where majority of candidates secured a job afterwards, which enticed me more to sign up for AcademyXI, especially in the wake of the COVID outbreak that raised job instability and unemployment in various sectors.</p>
